# spam-ham-mail

Introduction: Spam mail is a pervasive issue, and machine learning provides a promising solution to automatically identify and filter out such unwanted emails. This project implements a spam mail detection system using a machine learning model trained on a labeled dataset of emails.

Features: Preprocessing of email data Feature extraction from emails Training and evaluation of machine learning models Detection of spam emails with high accuracy

Dependencies: Python 3.x NumPy Pandas Scikit-learn

Data: You need a labeled dataset containing both spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The dataset should be organized with one email per file, and each file should be labeled accordingly. Place the dataset in the data directory.

Model Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed data. You can adjust hyperparameters and algorithms in the train_model.py script to experiment with different machine learning approaches.

Evaluation: The evaluate_model.py script assesses the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Results: Provide insights into the performance of the model and discuss any potential improvements or future work.
